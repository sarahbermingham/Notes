# Exception Handling
	- When a program encounters an error, it completely stops.
	- If you pass a file name if a file that doesn't exist, the program will stop. 
    - Python allows programmers to handle these situations with try-except construct.

	- Try block: instructions that may fail due to error. 
    - When an error occurs here the rest of this block is ignored.

	- Except block: instructions to be carried out when try fails.


	- Else block: executed if the try block executes normally. It is placed after the except blocks.

	- Finally block: place code that will always be executed.


	Example:

		def open_file(filename):
			try:
				f = open(filename, "r")

				for line in f:
					words = line.strip().split()

				print("{:s} has {:d} words.".format(filename, len(words)))

				f.close()

			except FileNotFoundError:
				print("The file {:s} does not exist.".format(filename))

			else:
				print("Exited try block normally")
